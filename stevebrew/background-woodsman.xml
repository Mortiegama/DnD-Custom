        <description>
            <p>Growing up, you never knew the lavish life of a castle nor did you live anywhere in a major city or town.  At the very least you lived in a small hamlet on the outskirts of a land or maybe even deeper into the woods away from almost all people.  It has been a hard and possibly lonely life, but you’ve found a way to excel.  As a Woodsman, you may have chosen from several different paths but all of them involved putting in hard days works, toiling with the land, and learning the value that your effort would ultimately bring.  Having to spend so much time around just yourself and knowing that hungry beasts commonly wander the woods, you have developed a keen ear and sharp eyes.  </p>
			<p class="indent"> Were your parents woodsman before you, raising you in the forest?  Did something happen during your life that drove you into a life of seclusion?  Perhaps you wanted to find an honest living away from the crimes of the city and took to the forests?  Whatever the reason and the path you chose, you certainly excelled where few would be able to do such a thing.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You feel most at home in the woods, regardless of where they may be, as they remind you of your youth.  In fact, being in the woods sits quite well with you and you find that your senses are heightened by the familiar surrounds.  Any Perception checks done while you are within 60 feet of a wooded area is increased by 2 due to your familiarity with the woods.  You are also an expert in gathering food, water, and supplies; able to identify what is safe for consumption and what is to be avoided.  For every hour spent exploring, you can gather enough food and water for a full day’s ration or enough supplies to provide shelter, fire, and minor necessities for your party.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Standing in contrast to the mercenaries who haul in anyone labelled a criminal for coin are those who target thieves, charlatans, and murderers exclusively - and for no material reward. Vigilantes areas often soldiers dumbstruck by newly-found social decay and corruption whence they return home from war, as they are wealthy citizens with a penchant for martial prowess an axe to grind against their city's seedy underbelly for a past, personal transgression. As a matter of course, a particularly zealous vigilante may come into conflict with a bounty hunter, deeming her as guilty of violating the law as any brigand skulking about an alleyway. If you indeed wish to be a vigilante, select the Crime Doesn't Pay feature outlined below instead of the Names, Faces, and Places feature above. Living a life of vigilantism means that you will always be on the lookout for criminal activity, especially so if you're within the boundaries of a town or other settlement you claim as your home. The promise of payment never sways your decisions in whom you target, and you hold yourself to a higher code than your capricious counterparts - you consider it preferable to turn your marks over to the appropriate authorities instead of harming them. </p>
            <p class="indent">City guard and militia are likely to turn a blind eye to your unsanctioned activities unless you cross someone in their rank, be they corrupted, prideful, or otherwise. Additionally, as your reputation grows, you will gradually earn the accolades and support of the common people who find their streets safer, and petty thugs less inclined to hold them at knifepoint over a few coins. At the same time, organizations and individuals accustomed to using their coffers to help guide a settlement's definition of "criminal" (such as a merchant house, corrupt council member, and the like) will gradually grow to resent and perhaps lash out at your burgeoning reputation. </p>
